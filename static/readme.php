			 <h2>A brief introduction to DRAMP database</h2>

              <div class="mainform_read">

              <h3>What is DRAMP Database? </h3>

              <p>DRAMP database is an information portal to biological active peptides. Peptides in this database come from three sources

               : <strong>Public databases</strong> (Swiss-Prot, PDB, PubMed), <strong>Clinical antimicrobial peptides</strong> (preclinical and clinical) and <strong>Patents</strong>.</p>

              <h3>Why DRAMP Database is created?</h3>

              <p>Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are widely distributed in nature and play a fundamental role in the innate immune response against pathogens. They have been treated as a novel therapeutic approach to combat bacterial infections in the presence of growing antibiotics resistance. For the convenience of researches on AMPs, a variety of useful antimicrobial peptide databases have been established, but many of them are at the level of specific classes or limited collection of AMPs or in lack of analytic tools. Considering this, we developed a comprehensive high-quality, user-friendly data repository of antimicrobial peptides (DRAMP).Entries in the database have detailed annotations, especially detailed antimicrobial activity data (shown as target organism with MIC value) and cytotoxicity data (shown as Measurement of Hemolytic Activity, MHC).The database comes with easy-to-operate browsing as well as searching with sorting and filtering functionalities. Besides, several useful sequence analysis tools are provided, including similarity search, sequence alignment and Conserved Domain Search (CD-Search). Compared with the current databases, DRAMP harbors extensive entries with biological activity information and holds a dataset of peptides in clinical development. </p>

              <h3>What is in DRAMP Database?</h3>

               <p>The current version of DRAMP holds <b>29946</b> antimicrobial sequences. Information related to peptides in DRAMP can be divided into <strong>seven parts</strong>:</p>

                        <ol>
