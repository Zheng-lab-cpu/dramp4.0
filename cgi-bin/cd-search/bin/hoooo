>gnl|CDD|221746 pfam12739, TRAPPC-Trs85, ER-Golgi trafficking TRAPP I complex 
85 kDa subunit.  This family is one of the subunits of the 
TRAPP Golgi trafficking complex. TRAPP subunits are found in 
two different sized complexes, TRAPP I and TRAPP II, and this 
Trs85 is in the smaller complex. TRAPP I, but Not TRAPP II, 
functions in ER-Golgi transport. Trs85p was reported to function 
in the cytosol-to-vacuole targeting pathway, suggesting 
a role for this subunit in autophagy as well as in secretion. 
The overall architecture of TRAPP I shows the other components 
to be Bet3p (TRAPPC3), Bet5p (TRAPPC1), Trs20p (TRAPPC2), 
Trs23p (TRAPPC4), Trs31p (TRAPPC5), Trs33p (TRAPPC6a 
and b) and Trs85p.

>gnl|CDD|219646 pfam07924, NuiA, Nuclease A inhibitor-like protein.  This family 
consists of protein sequences that are similar to the nuclease 
A inhibitor expressed by bacteria of the genus Anabaena 
(NuiA). This sequence is organised to form an alpha-beta-alpha 
sandwich fold, which is similar to the PR-1-like fold. 
NuiA interacts with nuclease A by means of residues located 
at one end of the molecule, including residues making up the 
loop between helices III and IV and the loop between strands 
C and D. The mechanism of inhibition of nuclease A by NuiA 
is as yet incompletely understood.

>gnl|CDD|221135 pfam11566, PI31_Prot_N, PI31 proteasome regulator N-terminal. 
 PI31 is a regulatory subunit of the immuno-proteasome which 
is an inhibitor of the 20 S proteasome in vitro.PI31 is also 
an F-box protein Fbxo7.Skp1 binding partner which requires 
an N terminal FP domain in both proteins for the interaction 
to occur via the FP beta sheets. The structure of PI31 FP 
domain contains a novel alpha/beta-fold and two intermolecular 
contact surfaces. This is the N-terminal domain of the members.

>gnl|CDD|218602 pfam05478, Prominin, Prominin.  The prominins are an emerging 
family of proteins that among the multispan membrane proteins 
display a novel topology. Mouse prominin and human prominin 
(mouse)-like 1 (PROML1) are predicted to contain five membrane 
spanning domains, with an N-terminal domain exposed to 
the extracellular space followed by four, alternating small 
cytoplasmic and large extracellular, loops and a cytoplasmic 
C-terminal domain. The exact function of prominin is unknown 
although in humans defects in PROM1, the gene coding for 
prominin, cause retinal degeneration.
