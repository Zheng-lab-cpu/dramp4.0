Studies in mice suggest that it is predominantly expressed in brain and spinal cord in embryonic and postnatal stages. Mutations in this gene are associated with episodic kinesigenic dyskinesia-1. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2012]^^FHM^^The fourth gene found for FHM^^14^^23077016^[ddd]
