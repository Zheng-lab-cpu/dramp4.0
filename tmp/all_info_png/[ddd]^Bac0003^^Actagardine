Has good antistreptococcal activity.^^ ^^1AJ1 by NMR^^Non helix or strand structure^^Actagardine shows a rigid compact globular shape based on the constraining bridging pattern, which is composed of an N-terminal lanthionine ring from residues 1-6 and three intertwined C-terminal methyllanthionine rings comprising residues 7-12, 9-17 and 14-19. In addition, this C-terminal ring system is stabilised by a short antiparallel beta sheet. A feature of the actagardine structure is the presence of two putative binding pockets.^^R0028^^Actagardine inhibits PG synthesis by binding to lipid II.Actagardine blocks cell wall synthesis at a concentration of 100mg/ml.^^R0025^^Lipid II^^Antibacterial^^Gram-positive^[ddd]
