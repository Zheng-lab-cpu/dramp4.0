Genetic variation in this gene influences susceptibility to occlusive vascular disease, neural tube defects, colon cancer and acute leukemia, and mutations in this gene are associated with methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency.[provided by RefSeq, Oct 2009]^^MA^^The decreased activity of MTHFR, in case of mutated enzyme, determines a reduced cellular availability of methyl THF, the substrate for methionine synthase. This enzyme catalyses the transfer of a methyl group from methylenetetrahydrofolate to homocysteine, producing THF and methionine. By this way C677T mutation in MTHFR gene can lead to elevated homocysteine concentration^^46^^18672474^[ddd]
