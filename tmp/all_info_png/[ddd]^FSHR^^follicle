It is the receptor for follicle stimulating hormone and functions in gonad development. Mutations in this gene cause ovarian dysgenesis type 1, and also ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Mar 2010]^^migraine^^The protein encoded by this gene belongs to family 1 of G-protein coupled receptors.
